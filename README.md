## Welcome to DirectionR!

DirectionR is a simple Rails app that allows you to write and share directions. They can be whatever sort of directions you want: cooking, driving, coding, building, or anything else you can think to create.

The point of DirectionR is to help people do things. That's it. 

## Writing

All direction writing is done in Markdown. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, it is simply a markup language designed to render written content for the web, while preserve readability of the original text document.

You can find out more about Markdown [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Sharing

Every direction document you write is sharable on major social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Pinterest. If you don't believe in things like Facebook and Twitter, your directions have a static URL associated with them that becomes publicly accessible over the web, which you can then email to whoever you wish.

Future releases will include the ability to turn off sharing on a document-by-document basis.

## Images

A picture is worth a thousand words, especially when it comes to directions. Each direction document supports images up to 2000x2000, giving you the visual clarity you need to show how to do pretty much anything you need to.
